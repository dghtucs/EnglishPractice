-Hi,how do you do these days?
Hello! I’m doing well, thanks for asking. I’m happy to help you practice your oral English.

Haha, that’s a great description of pandas! Their appearance is definitely unique. They are very large and have big, black ears and patches of black fur around their eyes and legs.
It’s no wonder that they are loved by so many people! Now I’ll ask you about rabbits. What do you like about rabbits?

Pandas, rabbits, and dolphins are all great animals! I have some questions for you about each one. I’ll start with pandas. What do you like most about pandas?
i like pandas,rabbits and dolphins
Ah, that’s too bad. Cats can be shy sometimes. You’re still doing a great job with your English. Let’s try a slightly different conversation topic now. What is your favorite kind of animal?
no,they went away when i came close
That’s a great description! You described the color and even included an additional detail about the cats’ eyes. It’s good to use descriptive language when you’re speaking. Let’s continue our conversation with another question. Did you pet the cats when you saw them?
it's black with blue eyes
Great! You’re getting the hang of English adjectives. I’ll continue our conversation with a slightly more complex question. What color were the cats?
yeah
Fluffy and furry are similar adjectives that both describe something that is soft and covered in fur or hair. Fluffy usually refers to something that is more round and puffy, while furry usually refers to something that is long and stringy. For example, a fluffy cat might be a Persian cat, while a furry cat might be a Maine Coon cat. Does that make sense?
what does fluffy and furry mean
Sure, I can give you some suggestions. Some other adjectives you could use to describe the cats are fluffy, furry, playful, energetic, or adorable. Do any of those adjectives seem like a good fit?
beautiful,slim,i can't,can u give me a few?
Aww, that’s so cute! You’re doing great with simple sentences. I have a suggestion for you. It’s good to use adjectives when describing things, like when you said the cats were cute. Do you know any other adjectives you could use to describe the cats?
yeah,i saw a few cats,they were really cute
You’re welcome! I’m glad to help. We can continue our conversation with another simple question. My next question is: did you see anything interesting while you were out for a walk?
oh thank u,let's continue conversation
Great! You’re using simple sentences and verbs, which is good for practicing your oral English. I have a suggestion for you, though. In English, we don’t typically use the term “went out walking”. Instead, we would say “went for a walk”. Does that make sense?
oh,I did my homework,and went out walking
Sure, I will do my best to correct your mistakes and give you feedback on your speaking. Let’s begin! My first question is: what did you do today?
ready,and please point out my mistakes in my words
Okay, let’s start! I’ll ask you some questions about your day, and you can answer in English. Ready?
yes,let's begin
